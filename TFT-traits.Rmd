## TFT champions and traits

The figure below displays champions and the relationships they have to various traits. Classes and origins are indicated.

```{r load data, include=False}
drive_download("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YcpAryA_AXxMxHq8DNIb6QjkoJjmBE-LxYlegOzpR94/edit#gid=1653168612", overwrite = TRUE)
nodes <- read_excel("TFT traits.xlsx", 
    sheet = "nodes", col_names = FALSE, col_types = c("text", 
        "text", "numeric"))
colnames(nodes) <- c("Node", "Type", "Cost")

edges <- read_excel("TFT traits.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Champion traits 6.5", col_names = FALSE, col_types = c("text", 
        "text", "text"))
colnames(edges) <- c("Trait", "Champion", "Type")
edges <- select(edges,!Type)
```
```{r network, include=False}
igraph::graph(edges = edges,)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
